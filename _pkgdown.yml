      The ggpack function provides the foundation of ggpackets, allowing the 
      packing of ggplot layers into a list within the ggpacket class and 
      handling argument passing with a familiar syntax.

    desc: >
      ggpackets handles much of the difficulty of passing arguments to specific
      layers within a collection of ggplot layers. To accomplish this, a set of
      aiding functions help to handle the way in which arguments are processed.

      The ggpackets class handles the collection of ggplot layers as a list as 
      well as provides methods for handling arithmetic with standard ggplot
      objects to seamlessly integrate with ggplot syntax.

      ggpackets relies heavily on intercepting arguments passed through ggplot 
      elements and handling the filtering of those arguments into the packed 
      components. A large subset of the parameters can be aesthetic arguments to
      specify plot elements which require special attention and handling to 
      ensure they are properly distributed to the packed ggplot layers.
